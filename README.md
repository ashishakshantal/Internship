Educational Process Mining (EPM): A Learning Analytics
Built an end-end solution in two months using Python, R, Tableau, SQL, for a data set that captures studentâ€™s involvement on an e-learning platform to identify how students have engaged with the Computer Assisted Learning Systems (DEEDS) and to analyse if the system helped students improve their performance. The dataset was contributed by the University of Genova.
